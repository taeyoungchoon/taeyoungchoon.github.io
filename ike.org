Internet Key Exchange (IKE, sometimes IKEv1 or IKEv2, depending on version) is the protocol 
used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite.

IKE uses X.509 certificates for authentication - 
either pre-shared or distributed using DNS (preferably with DNSSEC) and a Diffie–Hellman key exchange - 
to set up a shared session secret from which cryptographic keys are derived.

IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol and ISAKMP
