* DONE certificate

** expire

- certificate > system cert
- expiration TTL : 10 years
- renewing this certficate will cause an application server restart on the selected node
- 그런데 말이다 그런데 말이다 어떤 것을 그리고 그 다음은

** CSR: generate Certficate Signing Requests

- generate
- export
- signed by an external authority
- bind x
- it will be removed from this list

* TODO cluster

not so easy

** arch

- ise1.foo.com
  - admin as primary
  - monitor as secondary
  - policy service
  - pxgrid
- ise2.foo.com
  - admin as secondary
  - monitor as primary
  - policy service
  - pxgrid

** patch, when?

- version 2.6.0.156
- installed patches 1

- system certificate
  - used by
  - ISE Messaging Service
  - pxGrid
  - EAP Authentication, Admin, Portal, RADIUS DTLS
  - SAML
- trusted cert
- OCSP cert profile
- cert signing requests
- cert periodic check settings

** TODO register with WARNING, READ IT!

- deployment status
  - registration or sync initiated

** TODO cluster and some options

1. export kinds of certificate from ise1
2. import certficate to ise2
3. export certificate from ise2
4. import certficate to ise1

** case : ise2 status still warning 
** case : Oops, something went wrong at ise2

access is denied, please contact your administrator

** case : promote to primary

- administration nodes
- Full Sync
- the completion of Sync
- promoting this node may result in data loss at the nodes sync status is SYNC FAILED
  are you sure you want to continue?

** deployment nodes ise1

- monitoring role: secondary
- policy service
  - enable device admin service
  - enable passive identity service
- pxgrid

** deployment nodes ise2

- monitoring role: primary
- enable device admin service
- enable passive identity service
- pxgrid

** dnac > settings > Authentication and policy servers

- server ip address
- shared secret as x
- [X] cisco ise server
- username
- password
- fqdn such as ise1.foo.com
- subscriber name as x
  - then you can see at ise > admin > pxgrid > client name

** approve at ise > admin > pxgrid > client name

- status: Pending to Online(XMPP)
  - are you sure you want to approve the selected client(s)?
  - connected via XMPP ise1.foo.com(standby: ise2)
    - no connection to pxgrid node (client status unreliable)
