* TODO cluster

not so easy

** arch

- ise1.foo.com
  - admin as primary
  - monitor as secondary
  - policy service
  - pxgrid
- ise2.foo.com
  - admin as secondary
  - monitor as primary
  - policy service
  - pxgrid

** patch, when?

- version 2.6.0.156
- installed patches 1
- ADE-OS Version 3.0.5.144

** note : certificate

- system certificate
  - used by
  - ISE Messaging Service
  - pxGrid
  - EAP Authentication, Admin, Portal, RADIUS DTLS
  - SAML
- trusted cert
- OCSP cert profile
- cert signing requests
- cert periodic check settings

** TODO register with WARNING, READ IT!

- deployment status
  - registration or sync initiated

** TODO cluster and some options

1. export kinds of certificate from ise1
2. import certficate to ise2
3. export certificate from ise2
4. import certficate to ise1

** case : ise2 status still warning 
** case : Oops, something went wrong at ise2

access is denied, please contact your administrator

** case : promote to primary

- administration nodes
- Full Sync
- the completion of Sync
- promoting this node may result in data loss at the nodes sync status is SYNC FAILED
  are you sure you want to continue?

** deployment nodes ise1

- monitoring role: secondary
- policy service
  - enable device admin service
  - enable passive identity service
- pxgrid

** deployment nodes ise2

- monitoring role: primary
- enable device admin service
- enable passive identity service
- pxgrid

** dnac > settings > Authentication and policy servers

- server ip address
- shared secret as x
- [X] cisco ise server
- username
- password
- fqdn such as ise1.foo.com
- subscriber name as x
  - then you can see at ise > admin > pxgrid > client name

** approve at ise > admin > pxgrid > client name

- status: Pending to Online(XMPP)
  - are you sure you want to approve the selected client(s)?
  - connected via XMPP ise1.foo.com(standby: ise2)
    - no connection to pxgrid node (client status unreliable)
- [ ] subscriber name: Offline(XMPP)
- subscriber name_dnac_ndp: Online(XMPP)
  - Capability Detail
    - Core
    - IdentityGroup
    - SessionDirectory
    - TrustSecMetaData

* TODO two node cluster, shut or start

- stop : PAN(Standby) then PAN(Active)
- start : PAN(Active) then PAN(Standby)

* DONE cli

- show application status ise
  - running
  - not running
  - disabled
  - initializing
- show clock
- show ntp
- show timezones
- show timezone
- reload
- halt
- show retore status
- application configure ise
- password
- application reset-passwd ise admin
- [ ] reset admin cli password using ISE DVD
- application stop ise

* TODO cli more

- show logging

* TODO webui but more

- tcpdump to do wireshark later

* DONE role
  
** roles

- administration
- monitoring
- policy service
- pxgrid(identity mapping, session, profiler, device admin)

** if two m

- m1 : pri(a) sec(m)
- m2 : pri(m) sec(a)

** if more than two

- m1 : pri(a, administration)
- m2 : sec(a)
- m3 : pri(m, monitoring)
- m4 : sec(m)
- m* : policy service
- [ ] and choose some to do pxGRID service

* DONE and about, manual?

1. is a radius server, authentication server from 802.1X world, talk with authenticator
2. about role, persona in two node
3. webui and cli, WebUI and CLI(command line interface), Web UI or more IPMI way
4. name it to dns as a 'a'(address record, forward lookup) and 'ptr'(pointer, reverse lookup)
5. time, ntp but more about timezone
6. license
7. certificate(s), system, CA, CSR(Certificate Signing Request), expiration TTL
8. server installation vs appliance configuration
9. Cisco ISE in a Distributed Environment, Cluster
10. patch
11. doing backup and restore, more about source and certificate(system and CA)
    - config data with scheduling
    - operational data without, policy
    - restore with 'show restore status'
    - internal CA Store backup with 'application configure ise' then 7 then when?
12. ise and friends such as AD as a external identity source
13. ise and friends such as DNAC from Cisco Software-Defined Access, ERS and pxGRID
14. policy and element

* TODO policy

** element

- endpoint identity group, mac addresses with template uploading
- username list
- what about ip? static ip vs dynamic(DHCP) and about profiler's profiling even nmap/NMAP
- external identity source, AD
- result's authorization profile, profile but role
  - acl
  - vlan
  - voice domain permission for IPT

** policy

- policy set but policy list
- authentication
  - at mac list or username list
  - [ ] but? MAB or 802.1X(DOT1X) or more? default??
- authorization
- but more
- [ ] network device's policy?
- [ ] pap-ascii/ascii/pap(password authentication protocol)
- not no policy only backup but trouble shooting only exist
