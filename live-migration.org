* about live migration

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_migration

* think

- memory
- shared storage
- network

** DONE memory

- off
- on

*** on but size, matters

- if under 100g
- if over 100g

** DONE network

- possible
  - umount
  - mount

** TODO the dsk, disk, operating system disk, where are you?

- local disk, physically
- looks-like local but mounted from the fast(san)
- looks-like local but mounted from the distributed storage(ceph-like)

*** DONE physically local disk

- block migration

*** DONE san disk

- if san-ed but connected to all servers then
  - umount
  - mount

*** DONE distributed storage disk, dfs, distributed file system

- if dfs-ed but connected to all servers then
  - umount
  - mount

** data disk

- umount
- mount

    - cinder is a block storage
      - Measuring performance of Cinder with Ceph backend
    - Configure multiple-storage back ends

** words

- iscsi or fibre channel
- /etc/nova/nova.conf
  - live_migration_flag=VIR_MIGRATE_LIVE
- /var/lib/nova/instances
- ceph
- block migration
- live_migration_uri
  - This option is deprecated for removal since 15.0.0. Its value may be silently ignored in the future.
- live_migration_scheme will be qemu+tcp://%s/system
  - virt-type: kvm(default)
- nova.conf
  - live_migration_uri = qemu+tcp://%s/system
    - using management network
- nova.conf then
  - live_migration_uri = qemu+tcp://%s-lm/system
  - Set up your DNS to resolve hostnames with -lm suffix to IPs in your dedicated network.
    - using LM network
