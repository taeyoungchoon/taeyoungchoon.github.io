* TKIP (the basis of WPA)

Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or TKIP /tiːˈkɪp/ was a stopgap security protocol 
used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. 
TKIP was designed by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim solution 
to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy hardware.

TKIP itself is no longer considered secure, 
and was deprecated in the 2012 revision of the 802.11 standard.

TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC)

* CCMP

- CCM mode Protocl
- CCM mode : Counter with CBC-MAC 
- Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
- Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol
- based upon COunter Mode CBC-MAC(CCM) of the AES standard

* wpa2

The IEEE endorsed the final version of TKIP, 
along with more robust solutions such as 802.1X and the AES based CCMP, 
when they published IEEE 802.11i-2004 on 23 July 2004.

The Wi-Fi Alliance soon afterwards adopted the full specification under the marketing name WPA2.
