* is the vulnerablity scanner

The Computer Oracle and Password System (COPS) was the first vulnerability scanner 
for Unix operating systems to achieve widespread use. 
It was created by Dan Farmer while he was a student at Purdue University. 
Gene Spafford helped Farmer start the project in 1989.
