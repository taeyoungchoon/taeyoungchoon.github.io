| sdn   | network                         |

| sds   | storage, disk/disc, repository  |

* care,s

** TODO code

- roll on vm or container
- process changing, deploy by x, devops

** DONE network

- simply mad if not
- if vlan only then do this(vs vxlan, lldp, ISIS, LISP, evpn)
- sep sdn and pure network(with stp, mlag)
  - sdn is the app(using openflow, jabber, iptables, bridge)
- and linux engineer to sdn
- nfv, nf, f, function called firewall, load balancer like that
- f made of vm then container

** compute

*** DONE compute vs network

- word conflict with network, sdn,, simulate one by big picture(r)
- provisioning & management network exist
- protect management network

*** DONE vm vs container

- openstack lost market, kubernetes getting
- vmware combined with pivotal(cloud foundry)
- container network, much complicating
- sep vm world and contained
- sdn with container?

** DONE storage

- ceph, seperate with sdn if possible
- pure storage if possible
