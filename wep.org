* WEP, Wired Equivalent Privacy

In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). 
In 2004, with the ratification of the full 802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), 
the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated

* WEP is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.

- stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality
- CRC-32 checksum for integrity

* aircrack-ng to crack any WEP key in minutes.
* 802.11i (WPA and WPA2)

 WPA was an intermediate solution for hardware that could not support WPA2.
