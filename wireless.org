* BSS

one AP with station(s)
BSSID ( Basic Service Set IDentifier ), 48bit AP's MAC Address

* ESS

few AP share the same SSID
ESSID aka SSID

* frame

** frame type

*** control

RTS
CTS
ACK

*** data
*** management

Beacon
Probe requst & response
Authentication req & resp
Association req & resp

* beacon

AP cast

* passive connection

- beacon from AP to station
- auth req from station to AP
- auth resp from AP to station
- association req from station to AP
- association resp from AP to station

* active connection
  
- probe req from station to AP
- probe resp from AP to station
- auth req from station to AP
- auth resp from AP to station
- association req from station to AP
- association resp from AP to station

* roaming

below 30%

* RTS, CTS, Data then ACK but has IFS ( Inter Frame Space )

- RTS from station to AP
- CTS from AP to station
- Data from statino to AP
- ACk from AP to station
