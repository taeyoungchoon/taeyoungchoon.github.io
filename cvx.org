  - VXLAN Control Service
    - [X] allow hardware VXLAN tunnel endpoints share state with each other without the need of multicast
  - Hardware Switch Controller(HSC) Service
    - integration point between OVSDB controllers and the VXLAN control service
    - [X] allowing exchange of state information among virtual and hardware switches
  - Network Topology Service
  - Static Topology Service
    - show network physical-topology
    - servers does not enable LLDP on interfaces connecting hosts to switches
    - the topology information does not appear on CVX
    - [ ] static Topology enables the topology configuration statically 
      - using the service topology command on CVX
      - without running LLDP on the servers connected to switches.
