#+BEGIN_SRC 

    Configure a high-availability cluster, using either physical or virtual systems, that:
        Utilizes shared storage.
        Provides service fail-over between the cluster nodes.
        Provides preferred node for a given service.
        Selectively fails over services based on specific constraints.
        Preemptively removes non-functioning cluster members to prevent corruption of shared storage.
    Manage logical volumes in a clustered environment:
        Create volume groups that are available to all members of a highly available cluster.
        Create logical volumes that can be simultaneously mounted by all members of a high-availability cluster.
    Configure a GFS file system to meet specified size, layout, and performance objectives.
    Configure iSCSI initiators.
    Use multipathed devices.
    Configure cluster logging.
    Configure cluster monitoring.
