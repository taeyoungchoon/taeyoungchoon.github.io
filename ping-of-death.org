A correctly-formed ping packet is typically 56 bytes in size, 
or 64 bytes when the Internet Protocol header is considered. 
However, any IPv4 packet (including pings) may be as large as 65,535 bytes. 

* ping of death > (ping-flood smurf fraggle)

- ping-of-death : ping but big payload
- smurf : icmp, victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address
- fraggle : smurf way but using udp ports 7 (echo) and 19 (chargen)
