* remote desktop like that 

- I call it as remoting

* for example

** windows only

- Remote Desktop Services(RDS)
- ever called Terminal Services
- gg : Restarting Terminal Services Service

*** restart just in case

- tasklist /svc /fi "imagename eq svchost.exe" | findstr /i TermService
- then kill it using taskkill or other
- then restart it from services.msc or somewhere else (sc)

** vnc
