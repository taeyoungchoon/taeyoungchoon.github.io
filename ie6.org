* ie6 vs google.com but about tls maybe and openapi.naver.com too

Because IE 6 SP1 does not support the applicable SSL/TLS versions that the webservers you are accessing support. 

* Internet Explorer 6 > Internet Options > Security : Use TLS 1.0

fail to work with https://google.com

- [X] Use SSL 2.0
- [X] Use SSL 3.0
- [X] Use TLS 1.0
